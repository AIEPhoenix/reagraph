# Centering
Reagraph supports the ability to dynamically center nodes using the `centerGraph` method from the `GraphCanvasRef`. This method allows you to programmatically center the camera view around specific nodes or the entire graph.

### Usage
First, you need to get a reference to the `GraphRef`:

```jsx

  const graphRef = useRef<GraphCanvasRef | null>(null);
return (
    <GraphCanvas ref={graphRef} {...} />
)
```

Then, you can use the `centerGraph` method to center all nodes within view of the camera:

```js
graphRef.current?.centerGraph();
```

If you want to center the view around specific nodes, you can pass an array of node ids to the `centerGraph` method:

```jsx
graphRef.current?.centerGraph(['node1', 'node2']);
```

### Examples
In this example, clicking the "Center Graph" button will center the camera around all the nodes in the graph:
```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { GraphCanvas } from 'reagraph';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const graphRef = useRef<GraphCanvasRef | null>(null);

  const centerGraph = () => {
    graphRef.current?.centerGraph();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <GraphCanvas ref={graphRef} {...} />
      <button onClick={centerGraph}>Center Graph</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```


Here's a more advanced example that centers the camera on the whole graph whenever new nodes are added:
```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { GraphCanvas } from 'reagraph';

const MyComponent = ({ nodes }) => {
  const graphRef = useRef<GraphCanvasRef | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    graphRef.current?.centerGraph();
  }, [nodes]);

  return <GraphCanvas ref={graphRef} {...} />;
};
```
