# Hotkeys
The graph has a variety of hotkeys pre-configured to make
it easy to navigate the graph. The following is a list of
of hotkeys:

- `command+shift+c` - Center the graph
- `command+shift+i` - Zoom in
- `command+shift+o` - Zoom out

reagraph uses [reakeys](https://github.com/reaviz/reakeys) for hotkey
bindings.
